    "# Úkol č. 1 - vizualizace dat a web scraping (do 11. října)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * V rámci tohoto úkolu musíte stáhnout dat z webu (tzv. _web scraping_, velmi základní) a následně data zpracovat a vizualizovat.\n",
    "  * Cílem bude stáhnout data ze serveru https://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasovani.sqw?o=8 týkající hlasování současné poslanecké sněmovny, uložit tato data v tabulkovém formátu a pak vymyslet vizualizace a zobrazení dat, které umožní orientaci v těchto datech a zvýrazní zajímavé informace a zobrazit přehledně časový vývoj různých veličin.\n",
    " \n",
    "> **Úkoly jsou zadány tak, aby Vám daly prostor pro invenci. Vymyslet _jak přesně_ budete úkol řešit, je důležitou součástí zadání a originalita či nápaditost bude také hodnocena!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    " * Měli byste stáhnout data ze všech hlasování současné poslanecké sněmovny (tj. od voleb v roce 2017) a to až na úroveň jednotlivých poslanců. \n",
    " * Data by měla obsahovat i stručný popis toho, o jaké hlasování šlo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pokyny k vypracování\n",
    "\n",
    "**Základní body zadání**, za jejichž (poctivé) vypracování získáte **8 bodů**:\n",
    "  * Strojově stáhněte data a uložte je do vhodného formátu, který se Vám bude dále dobře zpracovávat. \n",
    "  * **I když nemusíte mít sněmovnu rádi, snažte se nezahltit server a mezi požadavky na stránku mějte alespoň vteřinu mezeru.**\n",
    "  * V druhé části Vašeho Jupyter notebooku pracujte se staženými daty v souborech, které jsou výsledkem Vašeho stahovacího skriptu (aby opravující nemusel spouštět stahování z webu).\n",
    "  * S využitím vybraných nástrojů zpracujte data a vymyslete vizualizace a grafy, aby bylo vidět následující:\n",
    "    * Odchody a přeběhnutí poslanců mezi jednotlivými stranami.\n",
    "    * Jakou mají jednotliví poslanci docházku (účast na hlasování) a jak jsou na tom s docházkou strany jako celek.\n",
    "    * Jak často spolu jednotlivé strany hlasují ve shodě a jak často hlasují odlišně.\n",
    "    * Jak jsou poslanci jednotlivých stran jednotní v hlasování (jak často hlasují stejně, kdo jsou největší rebelové).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Další body zadání** za případné další body (můžete si vybrat, maximum bodů za úkol je každopádně 12 bodů):\n",
    "  * Ve vizualizacích a grafech nějak zachyťte časový vývoj (např. jak se mění docházka, shoda mezi stranami atp.).\n",
    "  * Najděte jednotlivé poslance, kteří se nejvíce shodují při svém hlasování či kteří mají co nejpodobnější účast na hlasování.\n",
    "  * Zkuste rozlišit v datech důležitá hlasování a zpracujte vizualizace (také) pro ně.\n",
    "  * Zkuste najít hlasování, kde poslanci hlasovali nejvíce jinak, než obvykle.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Tipy a triky\n",
    "  * Balíčky iportujte na začátku notebooku (příp. na začátku scrapovací a pak na začátku vizualizační části).\n",
    "  * Využívejte markdown buňky (jako je ta, ve které je tento text) a naspisy, abyste usnadnily orientaci opravující(mu).\n",
    "  * Pečlivě si vybírejte grafy a vizualizace, aby co nejlépe vyjádřily to, co vyjádřit chcete. Doporučuji projít si pro inspiraci alespoň galerie balíčků `matplotlib` a `seaborn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Poznámky k odevzdání\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Řiďte se pokyny ze stránky https://courses.fit.cvut.cz/BI-VZD/homeworks/index.html.\n",
    "  * Odevzdejte Jupyter Notebook (příp. doplněn skripty), ale i soubor(y) se staženými daty (ať opravující nemusí stahovat data).\n",
    "  * Opravující Vám může umožnit úkol dodělat či opravit a získat tak další body. První verze je ale důležitá a bude-li odbytá, budete za to penalizováni."
